## Background

Longitudinal studies are frequently used in the health sciences (biomedical research, epidemiology, public health, among others) as they allow to examine how the temporal effect of a treatment or intervention. Despite their benefits, longitudinal studies present challenges with regard to data missingness, increased financial costs, and the different statistical methodologies that can be used to analyze them [@caruana2015;@mundo2022].


However, there analysis of longitudinal data can be complex as study design, missing data, and are factors that need to be considered in order to use a statistical analysis that is congruent with the experimental design and the limitations from the data itself. 

## field


good number to start between 5-10k
 
rationales for the methods used
 
how many papers use each method, or improved method
 
software, why people use what they use
 
reasons for why people use the same methods
 
 
 
 


##  Objective

This study aims to report the different statistical models used in the health sciences to analyze longitudinal data, in order to present anunderstand the rationale for the choices used by the majority of researchers. In this way, the use of such models can be contextualized and the implications of such choices can be analyzed.  

_checking how many people check for model assumptions and how this impacts the results they report_
